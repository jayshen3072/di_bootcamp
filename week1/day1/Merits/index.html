        <h1>Welcome to Merits Portal</h1>
        <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
        <article>
            Merits uses the RIBA Plan of Work 2020 as a basis for planning and delivery of our projects. The RIBA Plan of Work 2020 uses work stages to move a project from start to being a fully functional and opera-tional building.
            Each Developer / professional team will have their own way of planning project, however most of the methodology they use compares well with the RIBA Plan of Work 2020.
            <p>
            Using this plan, Merits has developed a chart showing the design process and expected deliverables at each stage. This chart is called the “Information Flow”.
            This document explains the process and what is expected as deliverables at each stage together with who is responsible.</p>
            <p></p>
            Using this process will ensure that Merits deliver projects successfully on time in an efficient way with all the care and diligence that is expected of a consultant.
            In terms of project planning and delivery, using this process is mandatory. Departures from this process will not be tolerated unless prior approval is sought from Management due to unforeseen circumstance that may have developed during the project.</p>

            There will be occasions where we are requested to provide our services when other professionals such as the Architect and Structural Engineers have well advanced into the design. In such situation, we are asked to provide information at stage 2 directly for example. We should be able to provide such deliv-erables however, we have to produce in parallel information that we normally deliver for the previous stages to catch up in a way. In such scenario professional judgement and common sense prevails.

        <h2>2 Resources</h2>
        <p>
            Once a project is awarded, management will allocate engineering resources to deliver the project. This will depend on the project size, complexity and timeline.

<p>Each project will be allocated a Responsible Engineer (RE), and depending on the project size and complexity other Discipline Engineers (DE) will also be allocated for specific disciplines to assist the RE in delivering the specific disciplines. On some projects the RE may also be the specific discipline engi-neer. This will be communicated through a planner on a regular basis.</p>

        </p>

        <p>
            <h3>2.1 Monitoring and Validation</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            As for all businesses, check and balances are mandatory procedures so that quality, liability and risk to Merits’ reputation is well managed.
Merits conducts at least two validation committee per week where all projects proposed outputs and deliverables are presented for validation.
The RE and discipline specific engineers are expected to attend these workshops and present their works to date so that the validation committee can debate / question / validate and give direction. However, it is the RE’s responsibility to ensure that any committed deadlines are met and that delivera-bles that are not validated by the validation committee do not get issued.
Attending the validation committee is mandatory for all RE. For projects that are into construction stage, each RE should present project status with any items listed on the minute of meetings.

        </p>
        <h3>2.2 Forward Looking</h3>
        <article>
            We imagine and design systems that have never existed before. Contractors construct our imagination based on our design. Typically, the design process is around 2 to 4 months and the construction period last around 12 to 18 months. When the design is not 100 % complete or when its engineering has not been thoroughly verified, we tend to spend a lot of time during the construction period resolving clashes, changes and the likes. In return, this cost us time and money that goes to waste. We must en-sure these inefficiencies does not occur which can only be achieved by forward thinking of all possible scenarios at design stage and well detailing our drawings and specifications so that the contractors do not find any ground for raising design deficiencies.
It is the responsibility of the Lead Engineer to ensure that our design is 100 % complete and thoroughly verified prior to going out for tender.
<p>Thinking forward also means that RE & DE run through this manual and produce our deliverables ahead of the work stages and schedules where possible.
There is no point waiting for input from others when it can be chased and obtained. RE are expected to chase other team members internally and externally to obtain necessary input so as to move for-ward with our design and site monitoring.</p>

        <h2>3 Engineering Services disciplines</h2>
        <article>
            Merits uses UNICLASS 2015 classification structure as prescribed by UK Government for use on BIM Level 2. Its use in building services application is described in BSRIA BG 56 which recommend a based format for specification. 
Disciplines are based on this format so that it is in line with BIM level 2. DE are expected to carry out design of each disciplines using structured approach. Two words are defined in BIM, “system” and “product”. A discipline is a combination of several products and systems. For example, toilet extraction is a system that comprises of several products such as fans, ducts, grilles, supports. Similarly, VRF is a system that comprises of several products such as outdoor unit, refrigerant pipes, indoor units, control-lers, cabling. However, both systems fall under the Discipline Heating, Ventilation and air conditioning.

    <h2>7 Stage 3 - Developed Designed</h2>

        Depending on the nature and complexity of projects, this stage can also be called Scheme Design, where the concept design drawings are developed into line diagrams showing routing and sizing of pipes, cables, ducts, vertical and horizontal openings, finalisation of plants location and plantrooms.
For some other projects of relatively smaller size, the drawings are developed into detailed design where they have sufficient information for a contractor to prepare his bid competitively.
